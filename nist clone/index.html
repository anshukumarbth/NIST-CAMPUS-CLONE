                    fiber optics for uninterrupted network service. The academic buildings on the green campus are where

                    the buildings has individual faculty rooms related to particular departments and high end labs.</p>

                    special focus on the students' overall progress and growth with a strong emphasis on sports and
                    extra-curricular activities. The college organizes various inter-college competitions. Cultural
                    events are held during college festivals. The NIST-ISTE chapter holds a three-day All-India event
                    called "SANKALP" each year comprising more than 25 technical and cultural programs. A special event
                    called WAVE, held every year, highlights the cultural talent of our incoming batch. "Waves" is a
                    smash-hit with students. It is replete with dances, debates, skits, mono-acting, just-a-minute
                    sessions, painting, cartooning, tattoo-making, dumb charades, antakshari, rapid-fire quiz and
                    multi-cultural fashion parade. Students also put up their own food and games stalls. "Waves",
                    therefore, is total fun.
